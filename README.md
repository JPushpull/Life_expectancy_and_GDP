# About the Project

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of data pertaining to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and life expectancy, sourced from the World Health Organization and the World Bank. The objective is to derive meaningful insights and examine the potential correlations between these two indicators.

## Data Sources

The GDP data is obtained from the World Bank national accounts data and the OECD National Accounts data files. Life expectancy data is sourced from the World Health Organization. The dataset, contained in `all_data.csv`, comprises the following columns:

- **Country**: The nation being observed
- **Year**: The year of observation
- **Life expectancy at birth (years)**: The average number of years a newborn is expected to live
- **GDP**: The Gross Domestic Product measured in U.S. dollars

## Project Objectives

The project aims to achieve the following:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conduct an in-depth exploration and cleaning of the dataset
   - Validate the integrity and accuracy of the data

2. **Data Analysis**:
   The analysis seeks to address several key questions:
   - How is GDP distributed across countries? Are there more high-income or low-income nations?
   - What is the distribution of life expectancy at birth? Do most countries have high life expectancy?
   - What are the average GDP and life expectancy values for each country?
   - How have countries historically performed in terms of GDP? Have their GDPs generally increased or decreased?
   - How has life expectancy evolved over time in different countries? Have these values generally risen or fallen?
   - Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy?
